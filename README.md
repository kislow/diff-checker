## Introduction

This is a minimal web tool for text comparison made in JavaScript and PHP. 

## Getting Started

Install required npm package (express):
```bash
npm install express
```

Start application:
```bash
node app.js
```

Access diff tool on your browser:
```html
localhost:8080
```

## Usage

To use it, simply paste the original text into the first field and the modified text into the second one, then click `compare text`.

You can identify the lines that have been changed as follows:
```
line number    | original text >> modified text
```

Lines with no changes have the format:
```
line number    | original text
```

Then finally, lines removed:
```
line number    | [Removed] original text
```
